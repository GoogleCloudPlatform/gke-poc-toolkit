# FAQ

The GKE PoC Toolkit sets out to provide a set of infrastructure as code (IaC) which deploys GKE clusters with a strong security posture that can be used to step through demos, stand up a POC, and deliver a codified example which can be the basis of a production implementation in your own CICD pipelines.


* All testing and proofing of these demos have been vetted on cloudshell. You don't have to use cloudshell, but we know with certaintity that tooling is correct there.

* When rerunning the demo you might come across some errors. Try deleting the repo, re-cloning it, as this is a quick way to get past a bunch of issues.
