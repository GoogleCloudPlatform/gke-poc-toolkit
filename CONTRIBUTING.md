## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License Agreement (CLA).

Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one (even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it again.

## Code Submission

* All community contributions must be linked to an existing issue. If an issue does not exist, please create one descibing the issue resolved by the associated pull request. Instructions on how to link a pull request to an issue can be found  in the GitHub following doc - [Linking a pull request to an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue). 

* All submissions, including submissions by project members, will be reviewed before merge. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult [GitHub help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more information on using pull requests. All pull requests are linted and integration tests performed to maintain a standard of quality.
